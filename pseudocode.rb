If you donâ€™t input anything (just hit enter) they respond with HELLO?!
If you ask a question with any lower-case letters, they respond with I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU.
If you ask a question in all upper-case letters, they respond with NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE
The first time you say GOODBYE! they say ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?
The second time you say GOODBYE! they say THANK YOU FOR CALLING! and the program exits.
To run the program, you would enter in your command line:

phone_answer = gets.chomp.to_s
flag = false

while flag == false
if phone_answer.empty?
  return "HELLO!"
  elsif phone_answer != phone_answer.upcase
  return "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU."
  elseif phone_answer == phone_answer.upcase
  return "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"
  elsif phone_answer == "GOODBYE!"
  return "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?"
  flag = true
  end

phone_answer2 = gets.chomp.to_s
 if phone_answer2 == "GOODBYE"
 THANK YOU FOR CALLING!
